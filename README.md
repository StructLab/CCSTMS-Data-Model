## Structure of the Repository

This repository contains all necessary documentation and data model files related to the project. The structure of the folders and files within the repository is as follows:

- **Documentation**: Contains the primary project documentation for guiding users through the purpose, scope, and structure of the data models. Detailed guides, such as the *Data Model Guide*, provide an in-depth understanding of the data model’s structure, purpose, history, and development process.
- **DM Docs**: Contains documentation specific to various data model categories within the project.
- **DM Files**: Contains JSON files for each data model component, providing structured data representations.
- **Ontology**: CCSTMS RDF and TTL files representing the extended ERA vocabulary "ontology".
- **Schemas**: Schemas in XSD and JSON formats for validating and structuring the data models.

  
## Getting Started

To get started with the CCS/TMS Data Model:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the repository locally to explore the data model files and documentation.
2. **Review the Documentation**: Begin with the *Introduction* document to understand the model's purpose and scope. The *Data Model Schema* and *DM Docs* provides specific details on the data structure.
3. **Explore the Model**: Use the DM Files, Ontology (RDF & TTL), and the schemas as templates for integrating this data model into your systems.

      *- Subset 026 (SS026)*               -->    used for Engineering of ETCS Telegrams, later also for configuration interface specification <br>


## Collaboration and Development

This data model is developed in collaboration with various System Pillar domains and is continuously refined based on feedback and implementation experiences. The model integrates best practices from existing railway standards and harmonizes them for greater efficiency and functionality.
